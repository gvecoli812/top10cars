                <p class="text">The E83 X3 is the first-generation of the BMW 3 Series that was introduced into the Sports Activity Vehicle market in 2003. BMW made a grand entry into the mid-size SUV market with the E83 X3, which is a strong competitor with premium SUVs such as the Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class.European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP)—a body that's saddled with the responsibility of providing safety performance assessment for new cars—gave the BMW E83 X3 a four out of five stars rating for adult occupancy and child occupancy. This means, in the event of a crash, the crossover has the necessary technology to protect children and adults.</p>

A great feature of the E36 M3 is its BMW S52 straight-six engine that gives a 321 hp and 3.2-liter displacement. With the impressive power and displacement capabilities, the E36 M3 would be able to cover 60 mph in just 5.5 seconds.To ensure maximum reliability, BMW equipped the E36 M3 with a compound brake system that limited the unsprung masses and also reduced their sensitivity to thermal stress.</p>
